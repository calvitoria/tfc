# TFC - Trybe football club

The project's goal was to create a restful API that connects to a mySQL database via Sequelize in order to read, create, filter, update, and so on.

## Technologies used:

> ⚠️ Front-end: React.js, RTL. (the front-end part was done by trybe staff, so I didn't actually made any of the code in the front-end part of the application. | Since I had not made this material myselft, they will not be provided in this repository. 

> Back-end: TypeScript, Node.js, Docker, Express, MySQL, Sequelize, JWT, bcrypt and Mocha / Chai. TDD was used as a development tool for the API. | Since the backend was develloped by me, you can find everything at the SRC folder. 

# Final result:

> First, we logg in: The validation is made by using jwt and bcrypt to encript the password when sending to the database.
> We can then search for matches, teams, update a match, create a match, and so on.
